                                    At 800 yards, a 5.56x45 bullet takes over 1.2 seconds to reach its target. The

                                    In the early 2000s, SOCOM needed a lightweight precision rifle for designated
                                    marksmen,
                                    acting
                                    as a middle
                                    ground between the M4 carbine and the M24 sniper rifles effective range. By building
                                    off
                                    the
                                    AR
                                    platform, the
                                    SPR had many
                                    advantages over a unique system like the concurrently developed Mk14.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    For military administrators, the appeal of the SPR was its parts compatibility.
                                    Since
                                    the
                                    SPR is
                                    just a
                                    specialized AR, the SPR uses all the same small parts and pins as the existing
                                    service
                                    rifles,
                                    making the SPR
                                    easier to learn and maintain.
                                    In addition, squads could share magazines out in the field, so a marksman could
                                    stay outside the wire without running dry.
                                    Administrators weren’t the only fans, though. In the field, the SPR earned a
                                    reputation
                                    for

                                <h2>MK12 Debate: 5.56 vs 7.62</h2>
                                <p>
                                    In terminal ballistics, 7.62x51 NATO (and .308) always had the edge for range and
                                    impact.
                                    However, this came at the
                                    cost of weight, capacity, and volume-of-fire. Until the SCAR 17, most .30-caliber
                                    marksman
                                    rifles weighed near
                                    10lbs. When you added optics, a bipod, and other accessories, a marksman rifle could
                                    weigh
                                    over
                                    14-15lbs.
                                    On top of the rifle weight, 7.62 limited a marksman's ammo reserve, as the 20-round
                                    7.62
                                    magazines were even heavier than standard 5.56 30-rounders. Where a 7.62 setup might
                                    be
                                    5+1
                                    magazines, a 5.56 setup could bring
                                    7+1 magazines and still have plenty room for more. With larger ammo reserves, the
                                    5.56
                                    marksman
                                    could engage targets more
                                    aggressively, taking advantage of the reduced recoil and flat trajectory for greater
                                    performance
                                    in urban and
                                    suburban environments.

                                    the firearms community.
                                    Some builders clone the rifle with complete dedication to original parts, even to

                                    rifle cases, but anyone can replicate the performance of the Mk12 in a more modern
                                    form.
                                    With this build, we wanted to capture that precision with a contemporary spin. If

                                <p>
                                    This barrel is even more impressive when it’s combined with a high-quality
                                    handguard, so
                                    we
                                    recommend a Geissele
                                    Super Modular Mk4 16” M-LOK Handguard. This handguard has a rigid rail and barrel

                                    for
                                    superior
                                    harmonics, plus the integrated rail sections make it easy to attach lights and other
                                    important
                                    accessories, such
                                    as a bipod.
                                    Muzzle devices are a tricky subject for SPRs, as flash suppression and recoil
                                    compensation
                                    are
                                    equally
                                    important. The Precision Armament AFAB Hybrid 5.56 Muzzle Brake helps with both, as
                                    it
                                    features
                                    an advanced
                                    hashed design that eliminates most felt recoil with reduced flash and concussion.

                                    SPRs aren’t just about the base rifle, though. An SPR is only as effective as its
                                    accessories,
                                    which increase
                                    the range and precision in the rifle.
                                    Rifle Scopes have come a long way since the Mk12’s original adoption, and our SLx
                                    3-18x50mm
                                    FFP
                                    Rifle Scope
                                    ensures that users can engage targets at any distance with superior accuracy. The
                                    excellent
                                    glass clarity and
                                    rich feature set of this scope is further enhanced by the ACSS® HUD™ DMR 5.56/.308
                                    reticle.
                                    This
                                    reticle
                                    provides the user an intelligent holdover system to engage targets out to 1000 yards
                                    with
                                    ease—perfect for an

                                <p>
                                    Our scope mount is a Scalarworks LEAP 30mm 1.57” Ultra Light QD Scope Mount. This
                                    system
                                    abandons traditional
                                    throw levers in favor of a patented thumb wheel design, greatly reducing weight
                                    compared
                                    to
                                    other QD mounts. In
                                    addition, the tubular boom and I-beam bridge improve the mount’s resistance against
                                    impacts,
                                    making it one of
                                    the most durable options anywhere. As if the mount wasn’t good enough, it even
                                    includes
                                    a
                                    built-in leveling
                                    screw, making it easy to guarantee the accuracy of our reticle’s holdovers.

                                    Illumination is another major factor with any SPR. Given the versatility of SPRs,
                                    our
                                    build

                                    answer for the darkness of twilight or early morning. Here, there’s no answer better
                                    than a
                                    Modlite OKW. The OKW
                                    is a 69,000-candela light that reaches further than any other weaponlight on the
